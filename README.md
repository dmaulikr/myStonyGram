# First Generic iOS App to test iOS APIs - Instagram for my university (myStonyGram haha!)

An iOS App similar to Instagram to use technologies like Core Data, Photo (Camera and Picker), Table Views and Segues
-----------------------

List of generic things implemented:

### Create an Account and Save it in Core Data 

The login page has an option to sign up and login, 

No Login Button as the GO(Return Button) will begin the process of login.

Sign up button opens a generic view controller to sign up. 

Issues: no unique username checking for now
